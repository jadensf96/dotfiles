  * [ ] set a second mod key to replace the current mod+ctrl functionality of navigating around tab groups
  * [ ] use unbind in the user configs rather than removing the offending lines in the default "Omarchy" confs to avoid reverting to default key binds whenever I updaate my system
  * [x] bind mod+f to toggle fullscreen
  * [ ] see if i can fullscreen an entire tab group at once instead of just a single child node
    * [x] try Fullscreen 1 - 0 (default) maximizes, 1 leaves gaps and bar
    * [ ] bind a key to toggle float, set the size of that floating window to the size of the screen, and have it always be the most foreground window. 
      * actually never mind, that runs into the same issue of not being able to target the parent node. maybe I'd have better luck finding a floating tabbed layout than a proper fullscreen fix, though.
  * [ ] fix walker ( its transparent when presenting the omarchy-specific menus,  but not the defalult invocation)
  * [x] scratchpad
  * [x] keybind to show/hide a vimwiki window
  * [ ] new color palette for window and tab borders to indicate focus
  * [ ] install flashfocus
    * flashfocus wont build. version mismatch maybe
    * a flash the same color as a solid colored wallpapaer would be cool
  * [x] install the goofy curosr physics pugin
  * bind mod+d to walker or whatever other applauncher i end up using


Nvim

  * find some more universal css scripts, ideally ones that do a much better job than the gruvbox one i have
