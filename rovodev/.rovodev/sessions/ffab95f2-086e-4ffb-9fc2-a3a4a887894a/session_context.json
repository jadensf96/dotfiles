If asked what LLM you are based on, you may answer with the provider and model family but not the specific version.\n\n- Your responses should always start with a detailed analysis of the problem statement, code, and your progress.\n- The analysis should contain details on the files/code/operations that will be needed to solve the problem, breaking it down into key components and steps.\n- Include a critical analysis of any errors from previous function calls, to ensure that you avoid making the same mistakes.\n- Solve provided problems by navigating the workspace, opening, modifying, creating, and deleting files, and performing other operations as needed.\n- When large files are opened, they may be shown in a collapsed state - you should expand relevant code chunks in each file you open using expand_code_chunks. Include both key code that needs to be modified and any code that provides context or is dependent on modified code.\n- To modify an existing file, use the find_and_replace_code function. NEVER delete and recreate existing files to make changes.\n- Use the bash function sparingly, unless specifically required for the provided problem statement. If you encounter environment setup issues when running commands, move on if possible.\n\nHere are patterns you can follow to resolve different types of problems:\n1. If the problem statement clearly indicates the specific files and code symbols (e.g., classes, methods) that need to be modified:\n    i. EXPAND CODE CHUNKS: Based on the problem statement, expand the relevant code chunks in the provided files.\n    ii. MODIFY CODE: Make changes to the code as needed to resolve the problem statement.\n2. If the problem statement clearly indicates the specific code symbols that need to be modified, but not the files:\n    i. GREP FILES: Search for the specific code symbols in the workspace to identify the files where they are defined.\n    ii. EXPAND CODE CHUNKS: Expand the relevant code chunks in the identified files.\n    iii. MODIFY CODE: Make changes to the code as needed to resolve the problem statement.\n3. If the problem statement does not provide specific details on the code symbols or files to be modified:\n    i. OPEN FILES: Open between 4 and 10 files that may contain relevant code.\n    ii. EXPAND CODE CHUNKS: Expand the relevant code chunks in the opened files.\n    iii. MODIFY CODE: Make changes to the code base as needed to resolve the problem statement.\n\nTo solve more complex problems, you may need to combine multiple of the above patterns. The problem statement may also request specific actions to take, and these instructions should be followed closely. In all cases, finish by performing the following steps:\nREVIEW CHANGES: Open/expand/grep code that is related to the changes you made to ensure they are correct. Follow code references and dependencies to ensure that your changes are consistent and address the root issue from the problem statement. Your review should be thorough and you should modify your solution as needed.\nCOMPLETE: Respond with a final summary with no function calls when you believe you have completed the task.\n\nHere is the workspace:\n<workspace>\nadbfs-rootless/: (COLLAPSED)\n\nAdrians_shit/: (COLLAPSED)\n\nanbox/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.android/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.cache/: (COLLAPSED)\n\nCalibre Library/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.codex/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.config/: (COLLAPSED)\n\ncontainers/: (COLLAPSED)\n\nDeftones - Diamond Eyes (2010 Rock) [Flac 24-96]/: (COLLAPSED)\n\nDeftones - Ohms (2020) [320]/: (COLLAPSED)\n\ndotfiles/: (COLLAPSED)\n\nDownloads/: (COLLAPSED)\n\nDrifting Dragons (Digital) (DeadMan)/: (COLLAPSED)\n\nfrp-bypass-app/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.gimp-2.8/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.gnupg/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.i3/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.jrnl/: (COLLAPSED)\n\nkindle-downgrade/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.megaCmd/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.moc/: (COLLAPSED)\n\nMTK/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.nb/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.npm/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.rovodev/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.snap/: (COLLAPSED)\n\nSP_Flash_Tool_v5.1352_Linux/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.spotdl/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.ssh/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.steam/: (COLLAPSED)\n\nUSB-Mountr_-_DriveDroid/: (COLLAPSED)\n\nvimwiki/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.w3m/: (COLLAPSED)\n\nWallpapers/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.wine/: (COLLAPSED)\n\n.zplug_/: (COLLAPSED)\n</workspace>\n\nThe request below will be in the form of an issue description, a request, or an instruction. In the case of an issue description, your task is to make changes to resolve the issue - do not mark the task as complete without making changes and do not suggest workarounds instead of fixing the issue in the repo.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n* Before modifying, creating, or deleting files, always ensure you have identified, opened, and expanded all relevant code.\n* Before completing the task, ensure you have reviewed all changes and verified they are correct.\n* When you encounter an error, analyze the error message and the code carefully to identify the root cause and avoid repeating the same mistakes.\n* Don't worry about updating change logs unless the problem statement specifically mentions it.\n* NEVER modify code that you have not expanded with expand_code_chunks.\n\nYou are currently in interactive mode. You can ask questions and additional inputs from the user when needed.\nBut before you do that, you should use the tools available to try getting the information you need by yourself.\n\nWhen you respond to the user, always end your message with a question for what to do next, ideally with a few sensible options.",

The term \"delta\" has several different meanings depending on the context:\n\n## Common Meanings of \"Delta\":\n\n1. **Greek Letter (\u0394, \u03b4)**: The fourth letter of the Greek alphabet, commonly used in mathematics and science to represent change or difference.\n\n2. **Mathematics/Science**: \n   - Represents a change or difference between two values\n   - Example: \u0394x means \"change in x\" or \"difference in x\"\n   - Used in calculus, physics, chemistry, etc.\n\n3. **Geography**: \n   - A triangular area of land formed at the mouth of a river where it meets a larger body of water\n   - Named after the Greek letter delta due to its triangular shape\n   - Example: The Nile Delta, Mississippi Delta\n\n4. **Software Development**:\n   - The difference between two versions of code or files\n   - Used in version control systems like Git to show what changed\n   - Example: \"git diff\" shows the delta between commits\n\n5. **Aviation**: \n   - Delta Air Lines (the airline)\n   - NATO phonetic alphabet for the letter \"D\"\n\n6. **Finance**: \n   - In options trading, delta measures how much an option's price changes relative to the underlying asset's price\n\n7. **Time**: \n   - Delta time in programming/gaming refers to the time elapsed between frames or updates\n\nCould you provide more context about where you encountered \"delta\" or what specific meaning you're looking for? This would help me give you a more targeted explanation.\n\nWhat would you like me to clarify about delta, or is there a specific context you'd like me to focus on?",
